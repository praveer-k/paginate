# Paginate
It is an awesome reusable code written in jquery. 
Writing a pagination in any server side application makes it hard for the users to traverse through a list. 
This extension makes it easy and is written just for fun !

The pagination has some default div ids which is changeable to class labels as well:

1. **\#pages**
2. **\#articles** (Note: it can be anything e.g. table, or ul li)

The only notable cavet is that you need to specify the __"limit"__ in both \#articles as well as \#filter. Note that both values must be same.
